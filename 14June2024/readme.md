# JS Topics Covered - 14 June

## Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. It is an essential part of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.

## Variables
Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. They can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

## Data Types
JavaScript supports various data types, including:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol

## Scope of Variables
The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in the code. There are three types of scope in JavaScript:
- Global Scope
- Function Scope
- Block Scope

## Difference Between `var`, `let`, `const`
- `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
- `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
- `const` is block-scoped, cannot be redeclared, and must be initialized during declaration.

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

### If-Else Statements
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The `else` statement can be used to execute a block of code if the condition is false.

```javascript
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
