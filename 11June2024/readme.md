## 11 June 2024 - Simple Homepage Creation

Today, I designed a simple homepage layout for a website. The page includes the following elements:

- **Header**: Contains the website's title and welcomes users.
- **Navigation Bar**: Offers links to other pages like Home, About, Services, and Contact.
- **Content Section**: A brief introduction to the company or service provided.
- **Footer**: Displays copyright information and stays at the bottom of the page.

### Tasks Completed
1. Structured HTML to include header, nav, content, and footer sections.
2. Styled each section using CSS for a clean and navigable layout.
3. Ensured the footer remains fixed at the bottom of the viewport.

This exercise helped me understand how to create a basic yet functional webpage structure that can be expanded upon with more detailed content and styling.
