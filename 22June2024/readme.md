### Project: Creating a Stopwatch

Today, I focused on building a functional stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is the detailed description of the logic and steps involved in creating the stopwatch.

### HTML Structure
- Created the basic structure using HTML.
- Included a display area for showing the elapsed time.
- Added three buttons: Start/Stop, and Reset.

### CSS Styling
- Styled the stopwatch to be centered on the page.
- Applied a clean, minimalistic design with a white background and rounded corners.
- Enhanced the buttons with padding, margins, and hover effects.

### JavaScript Functionality
- Implemented the core logic to handle the stopwatch functionality.
- Used a timer to update the display every second.
- Created functions to start, stop, and reset the timer.
- Managed the timer state to toggle between start and stop.
- Reset the display and timer state when the reset button is clicked.

The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed me to build a responsive and functional stopwatch with a user-friendly interface. The key challenge was ensuring the accurate updating of the display and managing the state transitions between starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
