## 12 June 2024 - Revision Class: Website Creation Practice

In today's revision class, we revisited the concepts of web development and practiced creating a website from scratch. The session included:

- **Review of HTML/CSS**: Refreshed knowledge on HTML tags and CSS properties.
- **Layout Design**: Discussed various layout techniques including Flexbox and Grid.
- **Responsive Design**: Emphasized the importance of making websites adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Interactivity**: Implemented JavaScript to add dynamic content and user interaction.

### Practice Tasks
1. Created a multi-page website with a consistent navigation bar and footer.
2. Applied media queries to ensure the website is responsive on mobile devices.
3. Added interactive elements like sliders, tabs, and modal dialogs using JavaScript.

This revision class was an excellent opportunity to consolidate my web development skills and apply them in a practical setting.
